# Week 1: RISC-V Bare-Metal Toolchain & Debugging
This week focused on establishing the foundational workflow for RISC-V development, including toolchain setup, cross-compilation, assembly analysis, and debugging. Key RISC-V architectural concepts were also explored.


# task 1 : Install & Sanity-Check the Toolchain
Step 1: Extract the Toolchain
```bash
cd ~/Downloads
tar -xzvf riscv-toolchain-rv32imac-x86_64-ubuntu.tar.gz
```
Step 2: Add the Toolchain to PATH

Append the following line to your shell configuration file:
```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Downloads/opt/riscv/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Then apply the change:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
Step 3: Verify the Installation
Run the following commands to check that the RISC-V tools are installed correctly:
```bash
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc --version
riscv32-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc --version
```
Output:
```bash
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc (g04696df096) 14.2.0

# Task 2: Compile ‚ÄúHello, RISC-V‚Äù (Minimal C Program for RV32IMC)
This section demonstrates how to create a minimal bare-metal C "Hello, World!" program and cross-compile it for the RV32IMC architecture, producing an ELF binary.


 Step 1: Write the Minimal C Program
Create a file named hello.c with the following content:
```bash
nano ira.c
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, RISC-V\n");
    return 0;
}
```
Save and exit the editor (Ctrl + O, Enter, then Ctrl + X in nano)


Step 2: Compile using the RISC-V cross-compiler</b></summary>
Run this command in the terminal:

```bash

riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -march=rv32imc -mabi=ilp32 -o hello.elf hello.c
```
 If you get an error like "cannot find suitable multilib", it means your toolchain doesn't support rv32imc. You can try replacing with:

```bash
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc  -o ira.elf ira.c
```


Step 3: Verify the output ELF file</b>
Check the type of the file using:

```bash

file ira.elf
```
output: 
```bash
ira.elf: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, UCB RISC-V, RVC, soft-float ABI, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, not stripped
```

# Task 3: From C to Assembly (RV32IMC)

This task demonstrates how to generate the assembly (.s) file from a C program using the RISC-V toolchain for RV32IMC and explains key assembly prologue/epilogue instructions.

üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Generate Assembly (.s) File
Use the RISC-V GCC to compile the C file into an assembly file:
```bash
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -S -O0 ira.c
```
View the output using:

```bash

cat ira.s
```
you should see the output something as this:

# Task 4: Hex Dump & Disassembly
This task demonstrates how to convert an ELF file into a raw hex file and how to disassemble it using objdump. It also explains the meaning of each column in the disassembly output.
1. A human-readable disassembly (addresses + instructions).
2. A raw hexadecimal file (Intel HEX format) that can be used for flashing or simulation.

Step 1: Disassemble the ELF file

Use `objdump` to convert your ELF binary into readable RISC-V assembly with addresses:
```bash
riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump -d ira.elf > ira.dump
```
To view it:

```bash
cat ira.dump
```

output should be something like:

Step 2: Generate the raw hex format
  
Use objcopy to convert the ELF file into Intel HEX format:

```bash

riscv32-unknown-elf-objcopy -O ihex ira.elf ira.hex
```

To view the hex contents:

```bash
cat ira.hex
```

output was like:

### Explanation of each field:


000100b4 -	Address of the instruction

1141 -	Machine code opcode (in hex)

addi	Mnemonic - (assembly instruction)

sp, sp, -16	Operands - (registers and values)




{The address is where the instruction resides in memory.

The opcode is the raw machine code.

The mnemonic is the human-readable instruction.

The operands specify the registers and immediate values used.}


# Task 5 : RV32 Integer Registers and Calling Convention Roles

This section provides a complete list of the 32 integer registers in RV32I, along with their ABI names and conventional roles in the calling convention.

### RV32I Integer Register Table:
| Reg No | ABI Name | Role / Usage |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| x0     | zero     | Constant zero (hardwired, always 0) |
| x1     | ra       | Return address |
| x2     | sp       | Stack pointer |
| x3     | gp       | Global pointer |
| x4     | tp       | Thread pointer |
| x5     | t0       | Temporary register 0 |
| x6     | t1       | Temporary register 1 |
| x7     | t2       | Temporary register 2 |
| x8     | s0 / fp  | Saved register 0 / Frame pointer |
| x9     | s1       | Saved register 1 |
| x10    | a0       | Argument 0 / Return value |
| x11    | a1       | Argument 1 / Return value |
| x12    | a2       | Argument 2 |
| x13    | a3       | Argument 3 |
| x14    | a4       | Argument 4 |
| x15    | a5       | Argument 5 |
| x16    | a6       | Argument 6 |
| x17    | a7       | Argument 7 |
| x18    | s2       | Saved register 2 |
| x19    | s3       | Saved register 3 |
| x20    | s4       | Saved register 4 |
| x21    | s5       | Saved register 5 |
| x22    | s6       | Saved register 6 |
| x23    | s7       | Saved register 7 |
| x24    | s8       | Saved register 8 |
| x25    | s9       | Saved register 9 |
| x26    | s10      | Saved register 10 |

| x29    | t4       | Temporary register 4 |
| x30    | t5       | Temporary register 5 |
| x31    | t6       | Temporary register 6 |

### Calling Convention Summary:
- **Caller-saved**: `a0‚Äìa7`, `t0‚Äìt6`. These registers may be overwritten by a called function. The caller must save them before the call if preservation is needed.
- **Callee-saved**: `s0‚Äìs11`. These registers must be preserved by the called function across calls.
- **Special-purpose**:
  - `x0` (zero): Always returns 0.
  - `x1` (ra): Stores the return address from a function call.
  - `x2` (sp): Points to the top of the stack.
  - `x8` (s0/fp): Often used as the frame pointer for stack frames.

# Task 6: Stepping with GDB
 Step 1: Start GDB with ELF
 ```bash
riscv32-unknown-elf-gdb ira.elf
```

Starts GDB with your program loaded.
 Step 2: Connect to Simulator

```bash
(gdb) target sim
```

Connects GDB to the built-in RISC-V simulator.
 Step 3: Set Breakpoint at main

```bash
(gdb) break main
```
Step 4: Run the Program

```bash
(gdb) run
```

Step 5: Step Through the Program
Step one machine instruction at a time:

# Task 7: Running Under an Emulator


Run a bare-metal RISC-V ELF program using an emulator (Spike or QEMU) and see output via UART console.  
This is essential if you do not have access to real hardware yet.

---

Step 1: Compile your bare-metal program with debug symbols

Use the following command to compile your C program (`hello.c`) and include debug info:

```bash
riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc -static -o hello.elf hello.c
```

Step 2: Run the ELF using QEMU
Use QEMU's RISC-V system emulator to run your ELF and get UART output:

```bash
qemu-riscv64 ./hello.elf


```


output :

 # Task 8: Exploring GCC Optimisation

Question:  
‚ÄúCompile the same file with -O0 vs -O2. What differences appear in the assembly and why?‚Äù

---

### Goal

To observe how GCC optimizations affect assembly output by comparing two compiler optimization levels:  
- `-O0` (no optimization)  
- `-O2` (aggressive optimizations)

 Step 1: Compile the Same File with Different Optimization Flags

Run these two commands to generate assembly .s files

```bash
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -O0 -S hello.c -o ira_O0.s
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -O2 -S hello.c -o ira_O2.s
```

 Step 2: Compare the Assembly Listings Side-by-Side

Command line diff side-by-side:

```bash
diff ira_O0.s ira_O2.s
```

Step 3: Key Differences to Look For and Why They Occur

| Optimization Aspect       | `-O0` Output                                | `-O2` Output                      | Explanation                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dead Code Elimination** | Variables and code are kept even if unused  | Unused variables and code removed | Saves space and CPU time by eliminating redundant instructions |
| **Register Allocation**   | Heavy stack usage, more memory loads/stores | Registers used efficiently        | Reduces memory accesses, speeds up execution                   |
| **Function Inlining**     | Functions called explicitly                 | Small functions may be inlined    | Removes call overhead, enables further optimization            |
| **Instruction Count**     | More, straightforward instructions          | Fewer, optimized instructions     | Optimized code is smaller and faster                           |
| **Stack Frame Setup**     | Full prologue and epilogue                  | Simplified or omitted if possible | Avoids unnecessary setup/teardown for efficiency               |



# Task 9: Inline Assembly Basics

 Goal

  To write a function in C that returns the current value of the RISC-V cycle counter by accessing CSR register 0xC00 using inline assembly.

  ---

C Function Code
```c
__asm__ volatile (
    "add %[res], %[a], %[b]"
    : [res] "=r"(c)
    : [a] "r"(a), [b] "r"(b)
);
```

asm volatile ("csrr %0, cycle" : "=r"(c));
- asm volatile
   - asm: Embed assembly code.
   - volatile: Prevent compiler from optimizing this line away.
- "csrr %0, cycle"
   - csrr: Control and Status Register Read instruction.
   - cycle: Name for CSR 0xC00 (cycle counter).
   - %0: Placeholder for the first operand (here, the output variable c).
- : "=r"(c)
   - "=r": Output operand (= means write-only), stored in a general-purpose register (r).
   - (c): The C variable that receives the result.


# Task 10: Memory-Mapped I/O Demo

Problem Statement:

‚ÄúShow a bare-metal C snippet to toggle a GPIO register located at 0x10012000. How do I prevent the compiler from optimizing the store away?‚Äù

 Explanation
   
- volatile:
  - Tells the compiler not to optimize access to the variable.
  - Required when accessing hardware registers or memory-mapped I/O.
  - Without it, compiler might skip the write because it sees no effect in program logic.

- (uint32_t*)0x10012000:
  - Casts the GPIO memory address to a pointer of type uint32_t*.
  - This assumes the hardware register is 4 bytes wide.

- *gpio = 0x1;:
  - Writes the value 0x1 to the register.
  - This could, for example, turn on a specific output pin.

- Alignment:
The address 0x10012000 is 4-byte aligned (divisible by 4), which is necessary for uint32_t access on many systems.

Why Flash and SRAM Addresses Differ</strong></summary><br>
  
- Flash (e.g., 0x00000000):

  - Non-volatile memory.

  - Stores program code that must survive resets/power cycles.

- SRAM (e.g., 0x10000000):

  - Volatile memory used for runtime data.

  - Faster and writable, unlike Flash.

 During startup, boot code usually copies .data from Flash to SRAM and zeros .bss, so variables are correctly initialized.

 # Task 12:  Start-up Code & crt0
 *Question*

‚ÄúWhat does crt0.S typically do in a bare-metal RISC-V program and where do I get one?‚Äù

---

What is `crt0.S`?
  
- crt0.S is the "C Runtime Zero" file ‚Äî the very first code that runs before main() in a bare-metal program.

- It's written in assembly and is architecture-specific.

- It performs system-level initialization that C programs assume has already been done.


Key Responsibilities of `crt0.S`
  
- Set the Stack Pointer (sp)

  - Stack is essential for calling C functions.

  - crt0 sets sp to a known safe memory location (usually top of RAM).

- Zero out .bss section

  - .bss holds uninitialized global/static variables, which should start as 0.

  - crt0 clears this region with a loop.

- Copy .data from Flash to RAM

  - .data holds initialized globals.

  - crt0 copies them from ROM (Flash) to SRAM.

- Call main()

  - After setting everything up, crt0 branches to your main program.

  - Infinite Loop After main Returns

  - If main() returns, crt0 halts or spins forever to prevent undefined behavior.

Where to Get `crt0.S`

- Option 1: Write Your Own

  - Very short (usually ~30‚Äì50 lines of RISC-V assembly).

- Option 2: Use from a Runtime Library

- Newlib and libc implementations often include crt0.S.

- You can extract one from:

  - newlib source

  - SiFive‚Äôs freedom-e-sdk
 
  example of crt0.s:

# Task 14: rv32imac vs rv32imc ‚Äì What‚Äôs the ‚ÄúA‚Äù?

### ‚ùì Question  
**‚ÄúExplain the ‚ÄòA‚Äô (atomic) extension in rv32imac. What instructions are added and why are they useful?‚Äù**

---

### What is the ‚ÄúA‚Äù Extension?

- The **‚ÄúA‚Äù stands for Atomic** ‚Äî it adds **atomic read-modify-write** instructions.
- These instructions allow for **safe, hardware-supported access to shared memory**.
- It is used when multiple cores/threads need to access the same variable without conflicts.

---

###  Instructions Introduced by the "A" Extension

| Instruction   | Meaning                             | Purpose                            |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `lr.w`        | Load-Reserved word                   | Starts an atomic load-store block   |
| `sc.w`        | Store-Conditional word               | Stores only if no one else touched |
| `amoadd.w`    | Atomic add                           | Adds a value atomically             |
| `amoswap.w`   | Atomic swap                          | Atomically swaps memory             |
| `amoand.w`    | Atomic AND                           | Useful for bitmask flags            |
| `amoor.w`     | Atomic OR                            | Used in setting flags atomically    |

---

###  Use Cases

- **Operating Systems**: Manage shared memory between tasks/interrupts.
- **Multithreading**: Protect shared counters or variables.
- **Lock-Free Data Structures**: Like queues or stacks, to avoid performance penalties from locking.

---

###  Analogy

Imagine you're writing on a shared whiteboard:

- `lr.w` ‚Üí You reserve a spot to write.  
- `sc.w` ‚Üí You try to write, but **only succeed if no one else has written there** since you reserved it.  
- `amoadd.w` ‚Üí You **add a number** to the current value, and it's done **safely**, even if others are trying at the same time.

---

### Why These Instructions Are Useful:
- **Synchronization**: Essential for implementing synchronization primitives like locks, mutexes, and semaphores in multi-core systems. For example, `lr.w/sc.w` can implement a spinlock.
- **Data Consistency**: Prevent race conditions when multiple harts access shared variables (e.g., counters, queues). `amoadd.w` can atomically increment a shared counter.
- **Efficiency**: AMOs perform complex operations in one instruction, reducing software overhead. LR/SC allows flexible atomic operations with minimal hardware complexity.
- **Scalability**: In multi-core SoCs, atomic instructions ensure scalable synchronization without relying on global bus locks, which degrade performance.
- **Use Cases**: Operating systems (thread scheduling, resource allocation), bare-metal (coordinating harts), atomic counters, lock-free data structures, interrupt-safe updates.


### Summary

- The ‚ÄúA‚Äù extension makes **safe concurrent memory access** possible in RISC-V.
- It is essential for low-level OS and embedded systems programming.
- It **distinguishes `rv32imac` (which supports atomics)** from `rv32imc` (which does not).

Method:
- Simulate two threads using functions in main.

- Use lr.w/sc.w instructions in inline assembly for spinlock mutex.

- Demonstrate protection of a shared variable (shared_counter) from race conditions.

Expected Output:

```vbnet
Shared counter: 3
```
Each function locks the variable, modifies it safely, and releases the lock.

---

### Concepts
- Spinlock: A busy-wait loop that tries acquiring a lock until it succeeds.

- lr.w / sc.w: RISC-V atomic pair that guarantees safe update without interference.

- Volatile: Prevents compiler from caching or optimizing memory accesses.

- Pseudo-threads: We simulate threads using plain functions to show locking logic.

# Task 16: Using Newlib `printf` Without an OS

This task shows how to **redirect `printf` output to UART** in a **bare-metal RISC-V** program by retargeting the `_write()` syscall.

---
- Implement `_write(int fd, char* buf, int len)` that loops over bytes to `UART_TX`.
- Re-link with `-nostartfiles` plus custom `syscalls.c`.
- Run in QEMU and verify UART output.


Important Note on UART Address

When running on QEMU with `-machine sifive_e`, the **UART memory-mapped I/O address is `0x10013000`**, not `0x10000000`. Using the wrong address will cause no output and program hang.

# Task 17: Endianness Check (Little vs Big Endian)

### Determine the endianness of a RISC-V RV32 system using a union trick to inspect byte ordering
In little-endian systems (like RV32 by default), the least significant byte of a multi-byte value is stored at the **lowest** memory address.


main.c

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

int main() {
    union {
        uint32_t value;
        uint8_t bytes[4];
    } test;

    test.value = 0x01020304;

    printf("Byte 0: 0x%02x\n", test.bytes[0]);
    printf("Byte 1: 0x%02x\n", test.bytes[1]);
    printf("Byte 2: 0x%02x\n", test.bytes[2]);
    printf("Byte 3: 0x%02x\n", test.bytes[3]);

    while (1);
    return 0;
}
```

## üìò What is RISC-V?

* RISC-V is an **open Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** ‚Äî a blueprint that defines the instructions a processor can execute.
* ‚ùå It is **not** a processor, Verilog code, or a physical chip.
* ‚úÖ It **can** be implemented in hardware using languages like Verilog.
* This decoupling is critical ‚Äî like a programming language is separate from its compiler, RISC-V is separate from the CPU that implements it.
## üìÖ Why We Did These Tasks


The weekly tasks were designed to build our understanding of embedded systems using RISC-V from the ground up. Each step removed layers of abstraction that modern operating systems usually hide from us.

| Task | Concept |
|------|---------|
| **Toolchain Setup** | We learned how to compile C code into RISC-V ELF binaries using a cross-compiler. |
| **Disassembly & `info reg`** | We analyzed how our C code translates into assembly and how CPU registers change at runtime. |
| **Memory-Mapped I/O** | We saw how to control hardware directly by writing to specific memory addresses. |
| **Linker Scripts** | We controlled where code and data sections are placed in memory, crucial for bare-metal systems. |
| **Start-up Code (`crt0.S`)** | We understood what happens before `main()` runs: setting the stack, zeroing `.bss`, and transferring control. |
| **Interrupts** | We configured and handled timer interrupts, learning how CPUs respond to asynchronous events. |
| **Atomic Operations & Endianness** | We explored concurrency control using `lr/sc` and verified byte ordering in memory. |
| **Retargeting `printf` via UART** | We enabled output without an OS by writing our own `_write` function to communicate with a memory-mapped UART. |
