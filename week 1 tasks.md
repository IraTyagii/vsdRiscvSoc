# Week 1: RISC-V Bare-Metal Toolchain & Debugging
This week focused on establishing the foundational workflow for RISC-V development, including toolchain setup, cross-compilation, assembly analysis, and debugging. Key RISC-V architectural concepts were also explored.


# task 1 : Install & Sanity-Check the Toolchain
Step 1: Extract the Toolchain
```bash
cd ~/Downloads
tar -xzvf riscv-toolchain-rv32imac-x86_64-ubuntu.tar.gz
```
Step 2: Add the Toolchain to PATH

Append the following line to your shell configuration file:
```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Downloads/opt/riscv/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Then apply the change:
```bash
Then apply the change:
```
Step 3: Verify the Installation
Run the following commands to check that the RISC-V tools are installed correctly:
```bash
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc --version
riscv32-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc --version
```
Output:
```bash
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc (g04696df096) 14.2.0

# Task 2: Compile ‚ÄúHello, RISC-V‚Äù (Minimal C Program for RV32IMC)
This section demonstrates how to create a minimal bare-metal C "Hello, World!" program and cross-compile it for the RV32IMC architecture, producing an ELF binary.


 Step 1: Write the Minimal C Program
Create a file named hello.c with the following content:
```bash
nano ira.c
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, RISC-V\n");
    return 0;
}
```
Save and exit the editor (Ctrl + O, Enter, then Ctrl + X in nano)


Step 2: Compile using the RISC-V cross-compiler</b></summary>
Run this command in the terminal:

```bash

riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -march=rv32imc -mabi=ilp32 -o hello.elf hello.c
```
 If you get an error like "cannot find suitable multilib", it means your toolchain doesn't support rv32imc. You can try replacing with:

```bash
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc  -o ira.elf ira.c
```


Step 3: Verify the output ELF file</b>
Check the type of the file using:

```bash

file ira.elf
```
output: 
```bash
ira.elf: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, UCB RISC-V, RVC, soft-float ABI, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, not stripped
```

# Task 3: From C to Assembly (RV32IMC)

This task demonstrates how to generate the assembly (.s) file from a C program using the RISC-V toolchain for RV32IMC and explains key assembly prologue/epilogue instructions.

üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Generate Assembly (.s) File
Use the RISC-V GCC to compile the C file into an assembly file:
```bash
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -S -O0 ira.c
```
View the output using:

```bash

cat ira.s
```
you should see the output something as this:
